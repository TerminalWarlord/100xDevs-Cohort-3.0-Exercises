# 100xDevs Cohort 3.0 Exercises

Welcome to my repository for the 100xDevs Cohort 3.0 course by Harkirat Singh. This repository contains code snippets, exercises, and projects from each week's topic in the course. It serves as a personal reference to track my learning journey and to easily revisit and revise concepts as needed.
